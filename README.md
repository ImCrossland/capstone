By: Triston Crossland

---

## Introduction & Problem Statement:

I am a data scientist contracted by Airbnb to develop an innovative recommender framework tailored to the Airbnb platform. My goal is to provide users with personalized recommendations based on their specific preferences and priorities. By incorporating user-defined indicators most important to them, such as 'quiet', 'friendly', or 'convenient', this model generates scores measuring their preferences with user-provided reviews and ultimately ranks Airbnb listings individually significant to them, enabling users to make informed decisions that align with their desired experience.

## Data & Data Dictionary:

Airbnb Data - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

We utilized the 'reviews.csv.gz' file for the city of Austin, Texas, as the test case for this model. This dataset contained more than **500,000 entries!**

**DataFrame: df**

- **listing_id**: The unique identifier for each listing in the dataset.
- **comments**: The raw text comments or reviews associated with each listing.
- **clean_comments**: The processed and cleaned version of the comments, ready for sentiment analysis.
- **sentiment_score**: The sentiment score assigned to each comment, indicating the overall sentiment expressed in the text.

**DataFrame: average_normalized_scores**

- **listing_id**: The unique identifier for each listing.
- **normalized_score**: The average normalized sentiment score calculated for each listing.
- **clean_comments_count**: The count of clean comments used to calculate the average normalized score.

## Framework Overview:

Our recommender framework utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze Airbnb data and identify relevant indicators for users' preferences. The framework consists of the following key components:

1. User Input:
Users have the ability to specify their preferred indicators, such as 'quiet', 'friendly', 'convenient', or any other relevant factors that matter to them. These indicators serve as the basis for generating personalized recommendations.

2. Data Processing:
We preprocess and analyze the Airbnb data, including listing descriptions, reviews, and other relevant information. This data is transformed into a format suitable for our machine learning models.

3. Machine Learning Models:
We employ a combination of supervised and ensemble learning techniques to train our models. These models take into account the specified indicators and learn patterns from the data to predict the suitability of each Airbnb listing for the given indicators.

4. Scoring and Ranking:
The models generate scores for each Airbnb listing based on their compatibility with the user-defined indicators. The scores reflect the overall match between the listing and the desired preferences. The listings are then ranked based on these scores, with higher scores indicating better alignment with the user's preferences.

5. Personalized Recommendations:
The recommender framework presents users with a list of personalized recommendations, showcasing the top-ranked Airbnb listings that best match their specified indicators. Users can explore these recommendations to find the most suitable accommodation for their needs.

## Model Evaluation:

We evaluated the performance of our sentiment analysis model using various evaluation metrics. The results are as follows:

- Accuracy: 0.9286
- Precision: 0.9310
- Recall: 0.9971
- F1 Score: 0.9630

The accuracy metric measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions and indicates that our model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92.86%, meaning that around 92.86% of sentiment predictions were correct.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. Our model achieved a precision of 93.10%, indicating that out of all instances predicted as positive, 93.10% were indeed positive.

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. Our model achieved a recall of 99.71%, indicating that it successfully identified 99.71% of all actual positive instances.

The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced measure of both metrics. Our model achieved an F1 score of 0.9630, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

These evaluation metrics collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of our sentiment analysis model in accurately predicting sentiment. The high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score reflect the model's ability to make reliable sentiment predictions and capture positive instances with a high level of accuracy.

It is important to note that our evaluation metrics were obtained using a specific dataset and problem context. The performance of the model may vary when applied to different datasets or tasks. Regular evaluation and monitoring of the model's performance are recommended to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance to the target application.

## Recommendations & Limitations:

Recommendations:

1. Further Data Collection: Consider expanding the dataset by collecting more diverse and representative data. A larger and more comprehensive dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize to different scenarios and capture a wider range of sentiments.
  
2. Fine-tuning Model Parameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures to optimize the performance further. Fine-tuning techniques such as grid search or randomized search can help identify the best combination of hyperparameters for the sentiment analysis model.

3. Domain-specific Sentiment Lexicons: Explore the use of domain-specific sentiment lexicons or dictionaries. Incorporating domain knowledge and lexicons tailored to the specific context of the data can enhance the model's sentiment classification accuracy.

4. Handling Negations and Contextual Understanding: Improve the model's ability to handle negations and capture contextual understanding. Negations can often reverse the sentiment expressed in a sentence, and considering the surrounding context can provide more accurate sentiment predictions.

5. Model Interpretability: Work on enhancing the interpretability of the sentiment analysis model. Understanding the reasons behind the model's predictions is crucial for building trust and gaining insights. Techniques such as feature importance analysis and visualization can help interpret the model's decision-making process.

Limitations:

1. Data Bias: The accuracy and reliability of the sentiment analysis model heavily depend on the quality and representativeness of the training data. If the training data contains biases or lacks diversity, the model may inherit those biases and exhibit limited generalizability to new and unseen data.

2. Contextual Understanding: Sentiment analysis models may struggle with capturing nuanced sentiments that heavily rely on the broader context, sarcasm, or cultural references. Understanding and interpreting sentiments within complex contexts remains a challenging task.

3. Subjectivity and Ambiguity: Sentiment analysis is subjective by nature, and different individuals may interpret and express sentiments differently. Ambiguous or subjective text can pose challenges in accurately classifying sentiments, leading to potential misclassifications.

4. Language Limitations: The sentiment analysis model may be limited to the specific language(s) for which it was trained. Applying the model to different languages may require additional language-specific training data or techniques for effective sentiment analysis.

5. Evolution of Language: Language is constantly evolving, and new words, phrases, and expressions emerge over time. The sentiment analysis model may not capture the sentiment behind newly coined words or the evolving usage of existing words.

6. Lack of Contextual Information: Sentiment analysis models typically focus on the sentiment expressed in individual text snippets and may not consider the broader context or the user's intentions. Incorporating additional contextual information or user-specific preferences could enhance the accuracy and relevance of sentiment predictions.
